## More info
#### Why are some numbers missing?
Not all entries have a spoken word in it.
#### Where are the videos?
Only the Dc branch has video, rest of the game is audio only.
#### What about translations?
Feel free to fork this repo, also contact me to make a seperate spreadsheet just for translations.
#### My file has an error in it, and I can't complete it.
Contact us on discord.

## Troubleshooting
Aegisub is retarded.

#### Cut audio, missing spectogram.
- Try the 32bit Aegisub version instead of 64bit.
- Install a [rolling release version of Aegisub](http://plorkyeran.com/aegisub/).
- Use [SubtitleEdit](https://github.com/SubtitleEdit/subtitleedit/releases) instead. (not sure about how it exports the files, ask me before doing more!)

#### Invalid characters.
This is a problem when converting UTF-8 to other encoding by Aegisub.
Be sure to use UTF-8 as encoding, if it doesn't work, retype the characters by opening the .ass file in notepad.
