Dialogue: 0,0:00:03.37,0:00:08.21,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,I believe in Misato-chan, but I wanted to see what was actually going on.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:09.02,0:00:15.96,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,The sensei said that there is an art magazine in America with a painting by a Japanese artist very similar to Misato-chan’s.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:16.93,0:00:21.42,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,I didn’t want to see the magazine, but I wanted to make sure.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:21.46,0:00:24.01,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,The picture in the magazine and Misato-chan’s painting looked alike.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:24.04,0:00:25.77,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,They were more than alike.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:25.78,0:00:28.02,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,I could not tell the difference between the two.

Dialogue: 0,0:00:45.45,0:00:47.45,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,Still, the paintings looked so similar.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:47.95,0:00:52.73,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,But I thought that Misato-chan did her work before this other person submitted hers to this magazine.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:52.98,0:00:56.78,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,I’m going to look into it and clear her name.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:58.04,0:01:02.86,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,Sensei said that people often come up with the same ideas at the same time.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:03.14,0:01:07.72,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,It was probably a coincidence.
