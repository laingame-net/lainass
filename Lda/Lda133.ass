Dialogue: 0,0:00:25.78,0:00:28.02,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,I could not tell the difference between the two.

Dialogue: 0,0:00:58.04,0:01:02.86,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,Sensei said that people often come up with the same ideas at the same time.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:03.14,0:01:07.72,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,It was probably a coincidence. But she also said that there would be problems if it was openly declared.
