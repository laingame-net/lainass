Dialogue: 0,0:00:00.00,0:00:06.00,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,If I became sick, what would you do for it?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:06.00,0:00:09.00,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,If you were sick?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:09.00,0:00:11.08,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,I mean if...
Dialogue: 0,0:00:11.51,0:00:21.46,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Well, since you are still young, I wouldn’t use any medical treatment for such minor symptoms... the way one uses medicine to cure disease.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:21.46,0:00:23.91,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,Why wouldn’t you use them?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:23.91,0:00:27.68,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Lain, you already have the power to recover your health from disease.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:27.68,0:00:32.15,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,If you depend on using those medicines, however, your body becomes weaker.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:32.62,0:00:37.80,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Usually children shouldn’t take medicine too much anyway.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:37.80,0:00:39.80,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,So what are you going to do?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:39.80,0:00:47.06,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Let’s see... I will use psychotherapy to help you, like talking with you as we do now.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:47.06,0:00:48.35,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,Just talking?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:48.73,0:00:54.51,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Hmm, it’s difficult to explain it. For example, we have a program to recover people from alcoholism.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:54.51,0:01:00.77,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,In this program, they discuss and present what make them drink so much and listen to each other’s stories.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:01.46,0:01:06.86,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,We call it "group therapy." I don’t like it though.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:06.86,0:01:08.46,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,Why you don’t like it?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:08.46,0:01:14.35,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I think people who regain their health from those group therapies would make the same mistakes later.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:15.02,0:01:21.84,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,They think that they can recover themselves from alcoholism simply by group conversation, but when they are alone, they will start drinking again.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:22.33,0:01:24.55,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I’ve seen this happen a lot.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:24.55,0:01:26.66,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,So what would you do?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:26.66,0:01:33.13,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I try to talk one-on-one as I do with you, Lain.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:33.53,0:01:34.48,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,And?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:34.48,0:01:38.00,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,And then, I suggest those patients to think about themselves.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:38.42,0:01:45.91,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I have nothing particular to support them but I try to analyze what they think on neutral ground.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:46.51,0:01:52.66,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,This helps them to recognize what is wrong with themselves, and then they try to recover their own health.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:52.66,0:01:54.88,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,We call it "non-supportive psychotherapy".
Dialogue: 0,0:01:55.82,0:01:59.82,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,If they start recognizing there is a problem, it means they are already fine.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:59.82,0:02:03.60,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,Is that enough to recover them from diseases? Sound simple!
Dialogue: 0,0:02:03.60,0:02:06.37,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Right, it sounds so simple.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:06.37,0:02:11.17,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,In fact, however, those things are more complicated and difficult to do than you think.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:11.17,0:02:13.17,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,Difficult?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:14.71,0:02:21.51,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,(yawn) I’m sorry. I need more sleep.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:21.51,0:02:26.60,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,You must be tired. Should you take a break?
