Dialogue: 0,0:00:06.12,0:00:08.52,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,But we have general criterions.

Dialogue: 0,0:00:20.62,0:00:23.40,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,As you know, the mind can be a difficult thing to understand.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:23.42,0:00:28.92,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,For that reason, psychiatrists have publications, and we communicate all the time, sharing our data and our understanding of mental illness.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:28.92,0:00:32.44,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,We accumulate data and categorize it so that we can diagnose patients as correctly as possible.

Dialogue: 0,0:00:36.54,0:00:41.16,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,To tell you the truth, we don’t understand much of this at all.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:41.16,0:00:48.04,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,If there has been a successful treatment method for a patient with a certain disease in the past, we can apply that treatment method toward a patient suffering from the same disease in the present.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:48.04,0:00:50.04,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Much of this has to do with experience.

Dialogue: 0,0:01:03.78,0:01:09.48,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,But from the point of view of the patient, knowing if one will become better is very important.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:09.52,0:01:13.36,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,In fact, the understanding of the mechanisms behind getting better is an area of study of its own.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:13.70,0:01:17.64,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,I see. It would be so much better if we could understand everything.
