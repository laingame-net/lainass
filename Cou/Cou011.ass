Dialogue: 0,0:00:00.20,0:00:01.77,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Hello, Lain.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:02.28,0:00:03.38,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,(in a soft voice) Hello.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:04.06,0:00:04.82,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Hmm.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:05.18,0:00:07.05,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,You don’t sound so energetic.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:07.58,0:00:09.41,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Maybe you don’t feel up for this.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:11.46,0:00:13.57,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Why don’t we quit now?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:13.57,0:00:14.17,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Okay?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:15.90,0:00:18.93,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,But since you came all the way out here, how about a cup of tea or something?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:20.28,0:00:21.10,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,What would you like?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:21.86,0:00:23.49,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Don’t be shy.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:24.74,0:00:25.30,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,I wanna do it.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:25.66,0:00:34.96,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,You don’t have to force yourself. That might make you feel even worse. Take my word for it.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:35.74,0:00:37.78,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,I want to be cured.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:38.46,0:00:42.25,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Cured... But you’re not sick, Lain.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:42.52,0:00:44.25,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,But this is a hospital, isn’t it?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:44.58,0:00:51.09,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Well, this place can function as a hospital, but I see patients at my research room as well.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:51.62,0:00:55.10,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Right now, I don’t know if you are really sick or not.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:55.97,0:00:59.78,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,My hunch is that you are probably not sick, Lain.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:00.69,0:01:06.64,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Still, if you aren’t feeling well or are worried about something, I’d like to be able to help you.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:07.25,0:01:09.96,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,I’m not sick?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:10.44,0:01:15.01,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Right now, I’m not completely sure, but you’re probably just fine.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:15.85,0:01:19.56,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Even if you are sick, I’ll make sure that you are cured.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:19.87,0:01:21.08,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,You’re absolutely sure you can cure me?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:21.08,0:01:23.84,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Absolutely. I will not let you be sick.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:24.32,0:01:30.18,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,Sensei, why are you so kind to me? Is it because it is your job?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:30.76,0:01:34.34,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Hmm... You’re right that this is a part of my work.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:34.94,0:01:40.32,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,But it’s a type of work that’s hard to see as just work.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:41.20,0:01:47.17,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Most of the time, I see patients, diagnose them as objectively as possible, and give them psychological treatment, but it isn’t enough to make them better.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.37,0:01:51.89,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I’m a researcher as well as a doctor.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:52.34,0:01:56.57,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,If I see someone suffering, I must try and help that person.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:56.77,0:01:59.93,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I want to do everything I can to help that person.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:00.44,0:02:02.49,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,You would do that for anybody?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:03.21,0:02:12.24,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,To be specific, if I see someone suffering from something for which the cause is physical and obvious, I refer that person to a specialist.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:12.68,0:02:17.46,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,If there is a car accident or a poisoning, that's what I would do.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:18.17,0:02:26.10,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,To put it simply, I’m not the kind of doctor who treats people who have something wrong with them physically.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:26.32,0:02:27.46,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,So I have...
Dialogue: 0,0:02:27.93,0:02:36.88,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I can’t tell for sure without doing a close examination, but I know that you had an examination before you came here and that no problems were found.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.12,0:02:44.18,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,And just by talking to you here, Lain, you don’t seem to have anything wrong with you at all.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:45.00,0:02:53.48,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,But you need to talk to me and tell me much more about what’s going on with you, or I can’t really help you with what’s bothering you.
