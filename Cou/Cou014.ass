Dialogue: 0,0:00:00.76,0:00:06.85,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,There are many people who have had experienced kanashibari, but we don’t call them "sick."
Dialogue: 0,0:00:07.85,0:00:08.74,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,But...
Dialogue: 0,0:00:09.05,0:00:13.50,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Hmm... there might be only a few people who have experienced what you have.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:14.14,0:00:16.93,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Still, I don’t think you should be called "sick" just because of your experiences.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:17.78,0:00:22.26,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,A lot of things can happen to a person while she’s young and impressionable.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:22.97,0:00:26.85,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,But I’m scared and I hate this.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:28.01,0:00:30.02,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,What are the scariest parts of your dreams?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:30.57,0:00:35.34,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,I start to feel that I don’t need myself. I feel that I am an unneeded thing.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:35.72,0:00:37.17,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,You "don’t need" yourself?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:37.62,0:00:42.17,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,I feel that I am being told to come back because I’m unneeded.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:43.18,0:00:45.16,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Come back? Come back where?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:45.34,0:00:46.48,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,To myself.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:47.08,0:00:54.34,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Hmm. This is hard to understand. You want you to come back to yourself?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:54.82,0:01:04.01,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,I don’t know. But it feels as if there was another myself, touching my body, ripping it apart
Dialogue: 0,0:01:04.33,0:01:05.42,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,(interrupting) And it’s painful?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:05.60,0:01:09.35,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,It isn’t painful, but it’s frightening.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:10.52,0:01:13.57,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I see. Does this happen when you’re asleep?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:14.01,0:01:14.76,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,Probably.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:14.76,0:01:17.76,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Probably? This happens sometimes when you’re not dreaming?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:18.33,0:01:19.26,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,I don't know.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:19.88,0:01:24.29,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,Sometimes it happens when I’m just sitting by myself, and sometimes when I’m talking to my friends.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:24.50,0:01:29.65,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Tell me what happens when you’re not alone. This happens when you’re just having conversations?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:30.36,0:01:34.17,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,Yes. While I’m just talking, it suddenly...
Dialogue: 0,0:01:34.68,0:01:38.20,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,How do you notice it? Do your friends call out to you?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:38.82,0:01:40.16,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,Suddenly...
Dialogue: 0,0:01:40.30,0:01:42.80,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Is there something that triggers it?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:43.42,0:01:46.54,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,I was afraid, and I felt better after staying motionless for a while.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:47.52,0:01:53.13,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Can you explain what it felt like, or what you saw? Could you draw a picture?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:53.94,0:01:56.48,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,No, I can’t.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:57.72,0:02:00.82,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I see... Oh!
Dialogue: 0,0:02:01.49,0:02:02.88,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,We have to end.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:02.88,0:02:04.33,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I’m sorry, Lain.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:04.33,0:02:06.76,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I have to go out and take care of some things today.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:07.29,0:02:09.68,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I’m sorry to have to stop right in the middle of a conversation.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:10.44,0:02:14.06,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,But it’s good for now that you can’t see these things.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:15.06,0:02:17.94,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I think that what you experience is probably similar to sleep paralysis.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:18.04,0:02:20.58,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I’ll do some research on it until next month.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:20.90,0:02:22.84,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,That’ll be my homework.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:23.80,0:02:27.16,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Your homework will be keeping a diary.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:27.62,0:02:28.49,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,A diary?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:28.78,0:02:33.06,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I want you to write about the things you did during the day, and what you thought about.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:33.62,0:02:36.14,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,You don’t have to show it to me.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:36.28,0:02:37.25,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Just write what you want.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.05,0:02:41.17,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I used to keep a diary when I was your age.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:41.84,0:02:42.49,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,But...
Dialogue: 0,0:02:42.49,0:02:43.06,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,You don't want to?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:43.73,0:02:46.56,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,It can be really interesting to look back on the things you write in your diary.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:46.58,0:02:50.37,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,We can be forgetful, so it can help you remember things, too.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:50.94,0:02:52.33,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,That will cure me?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:52.86,0:02:53.77,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Hmm.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:53.77,0:02:56.36,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,That probably doesn’t have anything to do with it.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:56.59,0:02:58.62,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,At least it's good for you.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:59.95,0:03:01.84,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I’ll explain more carefully next month.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:02.64,0:03:04.60,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I don’t mind if you don’t want to keep a diary.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:05.49,0:03:07.87,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I went and bought you a diary book, though.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:09.03,0:03:09.60,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,See?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:09.85,0:03:11.12,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,It’s cute, isn’t it?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:11.86,0:03:16.68,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I found it when I went shopping last week, and I thought it would be a nice present for you.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:17.02,0:03:17.89,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,Thank you.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:17.89,0:03:21.33,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,But don’t force yourself.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:21.68,0:03:24.45,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,You don't have to keep a diary just because I bought you one.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:24.77,0:03:27.81,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Feel free to write in the diary if you want to, though.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:28.96,0:03:30.40,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Well I guess we’ll wrap it up, then.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:30.86,0:03:32.36,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Make sure you’re not forgetting anything.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:32.76,0:03:34.53,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I’ll walk out to the gate with you.
