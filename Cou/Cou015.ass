Dialogue: 0,0:00:00.85,0:00:02.61,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,How are you feeling, Lain?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:03.46,0:00:07.72,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,I’m doing okay. How about you, Touko-san?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:07.88,0:00:14.88,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Pretty much as always. I could use a little more time to calm down and think things over, though.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:15.69,0:00:16.80,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,You’re very busy?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:16.96,0:00:24.69,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Yes... Ha, ha. Now our roles are reversed. I feel like you are counseling me.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:24.90,0:00:25.53,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,Ha, ha.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:25.53,0:00:30.82,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Ha, ha. By the way, what did you decide to do about the diary?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:31.62,0:00:33.90,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,I decided to keep a diary.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:33.90,0:00:39.48,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Wow, that’s great! I didn’t waste my money right before payday.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:39.93,0:00:41.13,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,I’ll pay you for the diary.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:41.13,0:00:42.92,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I’m joking, I’m joking.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:43.54,0:00:46.16,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,But I get paid well anyway.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:46.85,0:00:50.06,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,But I guess it's too low considering how many hours I work a day.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:50.92,0:00:51.98,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Oh, no.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:51.98,0:00:52.81,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,This isn’t good.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:52.81,0:00:54.46,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I'm just grumbling about myself.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:54.77,0:00:58.13,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,But you’re funny, Sensei. You’re a lot of fun.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:58.13,0:00:58.62,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Ha, ha.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:59.65,0:01:01.30,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Well, why don’t we begin?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:02.40,0:01:04.34,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Let’s pick up where we left off last time.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:05.04,0:01:08.09,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Have you learned the word "ego" at school?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:08.53,0:01:15.02,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,Uh-huh. I looked into it. It’s about knowing that you are yourself?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:15.38,0:01:16.01,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:16.61,0:01:21.08,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,People around your age can get unsure about that.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:22.18,0:01:32.34,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,They ask themselves "what kind of person am I?" Boys sometimes think that they are heroes and that they will accomplish some superhuman feat someday.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:32.77,0:01:36.90,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Girls sometimes imagine that they don't belong with their own families.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:37.13,0:01:44.90,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,They think instead that they are members of a rich elite family, and that a prince on a white steed will surely come one day to take them away.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:45.84,0:01:50.26,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,I don’t feel that way. I think that I’m just me.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:50.86,0:01:56.40,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,But It’s hard to tell what you are just by yourself, isn’t it?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:57.28,0:02:05.01,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,When I was younger, I thought that there was a different me, and that somehow I wasn't the person I was at the time.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:05.28,0:02:06.38,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,A different me?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:06.52,0:02:07.38,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Yes.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:07.78,0:02:15.72,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,For example, if there was something happening that I didn’t like, I wondered why I had to be the one dealing with it.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:16.22,0:02:20.02,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I thought there had to be some kind of mistake.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:20.68,0:02:25.01,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I thought that someday I would return to the real me.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:25.74,0:02:31.32,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I also thought things like, if there was a big earthquake, everyone would die, but I would be the only survivor.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:32.14,0:02:35.02,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I thought that I was someone special; someone "chosen." In another words, I believed in a "me" that could not be.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:35.18,0:02:36.48,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,It’s funny, isn’t it?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:36.97,0:02:41.56,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,I don’t believe that I’m anyone chosen. I’m okay with being ordinary.
