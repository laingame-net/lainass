Dialogue: 0,0:00:00.37,0:00:03.00,Default,Toko,0,0,0,,Have you seen or heard anything since then?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:03.68,0:00:04.24,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,No.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:04.94,0:00:06.21,Default,Toko,0,0,0,,See!
Dialogue: 0,0:00:07.02,0:00:09.09,Default,Toko,0,0,0,,It was a state of mind, Lain.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:09.96,0:00:14.24,Default,Toko,0,0,0,,I think that you probably won’t see them again, but if you do, don’t get discouraged.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:14.85,0:00:16.08,Default,Toko,0,0,0,,You’ll get over it gradually.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:17.01,0:00:18.18,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,I won’t get better right away?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:18.57,0:00:24.77,Default,Toko,0,0,0,,Hmm. I don’t know. How old were you when you started having problems with them?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:25.64,0:00:26.81,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,I was eleven.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:27.57,0:00:34.01,Default,Toko,0,0,0,,So it’s been over a year now. During that time, how often did it happen?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:34.62,0:00:37.30,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,I don’t remember… once.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:38.72,0:00:43.70,Default,Toko,0,0,0,,Sometimes, even if there doesn't seem to be an explanation for it immediately, these things may go away.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:44.57,0:00:49.45,Default,Toko,0,0,0,,But if you decide that they’ve gone away completely and become complacent, there’s a chance that they may come back.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:50.01,0:00:57.84,Default,Toko,0,0,0,,I can’t say for certain that that will happen with you, but even if you don’t see them for a while, I’d like you to continue what you’ve been doing up till now.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:59.10,0:01:01.98,Default,Toko,0,0,0,,Do you want to stop coming here, Lain?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:02.34,0:01:06.49,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,No. I like seeing you.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:07.09,0:01:07.61,Default,Toko,0,0,0,,Thank you.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:08.44,0:01:09.77,Default,Toko,0,0,0,,I guess that there’s no problem, then.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:11.00,0:01:16.10,Default,Toko,0,0,0,,You’re doing well, but you’ll promise me that you will keep coming here?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:16.86,0:01:20.53,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,Yes. In exchange, I want you to teach me some things.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:21.16,0:01:21.89,Default,Toko,0,0,0,,Why?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:22.10,0:01:22.97,Default,Toko,0,0,0,,For homework?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:23.92,0:01:24.53,Default,Toko,0,0,0,,Sure.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:25.01,0:01:30.09,Default,Toko,0,0,0,,You won’t believe it, but I was pretty sharp in junior high school.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:30.90,0:01:31.46,Default,Toko,0,0,0,,Ha, ha.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:32.18,0:01:33.46,Default,Toko,0,0,0,,Learning to read and write was tough, though.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:34.06,0:01:39.98,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,I don’t mean that. I want to know more about your work. Is that ok?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:41.38,0:01:42.86,Default,Toko,0,0,0,,Hmm.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:42.88,0:01:54.22,Default,Toko,0,0,0,,I don't think it’s a very good idea, but if you’re really curious, ok. Learning about things that make you curious is a great way to study.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:55.12,0:01:57.78,Default,Toko,0,0,0,,But you have to make time for your schoolwork, too.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:58.72,0:02:00.16,Default,Toko,0,0,0,,I’ll promise to teach you about my work if you promise to do your schoolwork.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:00.48,0:02:02.01,Default,Toko,0,0,0,,Can you promise me that?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:02.94,0:02:04.28,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,Yes, I promise.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:05.00,0:02:06.10,Default,Toko,0,0,0,,And if you break your promise…
Dialogue: 0,0:02:06.73,0:02:08.02,Default,Lain and Toko together,0,0,0,,I’ll whack you with a blowfish!
