Dialogue: 0,0:00:00.47,0:00:03.10,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Have you seen or heard anything since then?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:03.78,0:00:04.34,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,No.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:05.04,0:00:06.31,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,See!
Dialogue: 0,0:00:07.12,0:00:09.19,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,It was a state of mind, Lain.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:10.06,0:00:14.34,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I think that you probably won’t see them again, but if you do, don’t get discouraged.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:14.95,0:00:16.18,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,You’ll get over it gradually.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:17.11,0:00:18.28,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,I won’t get better right away?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:18.67,0:00:24.87,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Hmm. I don’t know. How old were you when you started having problems with them?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:25.74,0:00:26.91,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,I was eleven.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:27.67,0:00:34.11,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,So it’s been over a year now. During that time, how often did it happen?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:34.72,0:00:37.40,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,I don’t remember... many times.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:38.82,0:00:43.80,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Sometimes, even if there doesn't seem to be an explanation for it immediately, these things may go away.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:44.67,0:00:49.55,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,But if you decide that they’ve gone away completely and become complacent, there’s a chance that they may come back.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:50.11,0:00:57.94,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I can’t say for certain that that will happen with you, but even if you don’t see them for a while, I’d like you to continue what you’ve been doing up till now.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:59.20,0:01:02.08,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Do you want to stop coming here, Lain?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:02.44,0:01:06.59,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,No. I like seeing you.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:07.19,0:01:07.71,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Thank you.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:08.54,0:01:09.87,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I guess that there’s no problem, then.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:11.10,0:01:16.20,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,You’re doing well, but you’ll promise me that you will keep coming here?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:16.96,0:01:20.63,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,Yes. In exchange, I want you to teach me some things.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:21.26,0:01:21.99,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Why?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:22.20,0:01:23.07,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,For homework?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:24.02,0:01:24.63,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Sure.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:25.11,0:01:30.19,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,You won’t believe it, but I was pretty sharp in junior high school.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:31.00,0:01:31.56,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Ha, ha.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:32.10,0:01:33.65,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Learning to read and write was tough, though.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:34.22,0:01:40.16,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,I don’t mean that. I want to know more about your work. Is that okay?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:41.51,0:01:42.96,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Hmm.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:42.98,0:01:54.45,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I don't think it’s a very good idea, but if you’re really curious, okay. Learning about things that make you curious is a great way to study.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:55.24,0:01:57.95,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,But you have to make time for your schoolwork, too.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:58.86,0:02:00.65,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I’ll promise to teach you about my work if you promise to do your schoolwork.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:00.65,0:02:02.20,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Can you promise me that?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:03.04,0:02:04.38,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,Yes, I promise.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:05.10,0:02:06.20,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,And if you break your promise...
Dialogue: 0,0:02:06.83,0:02:08.12,Default,Lain and Touko together,0,0,0,,I’ll whack you with a blowfish!
