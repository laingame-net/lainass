Dialogue: 0,0:00:00.86,0:00:03.86,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,The ego is your sense of who you are, isn’t it?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:04.60,0:00:12.56,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Yes, but more technically phrased, the ego is a part of the mind you use to experience as yourself and to recognize yourself.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:12.97,0:00:13.69,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Do you get it?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:14.20,0:00:14.97,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,Not at all.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:15.53,0:00:19.16,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Okay, so you have an idea that you are Lain.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:19.96,0:00:23.09,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,In such the structural element, the "EGO" is right there.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:24.02,0:00:28.88,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Linguistically, "myself" describes all of you, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:29.86,0:00:36.64,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,"Ego" is, however, one of the parts of your mind you use to recognize that all of experiences I have had were mine.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:38.00,0:00:41.41,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Saying "it’s just to realize that you are yourself" is somewhat better to understand?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:42.26,0:00:46.04,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,I can get the last part, but it is still beyond my understanding.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:46.21,0:00:48.24,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I like your honesty.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:49.57,0:00:56.38,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,So the girl, Lain, has various emotions, such as kindness, loneliness and things like that.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:57.06,0:01:00.24,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Now the EGO is what is left when you don’t feel any emotions.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:00.89,0:01:03.30,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,I guess I understand a little...
Dialogue: 0,0:01:04.06,0:01:10.73,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,For example, the Lain who woke up this morning and what Lain is now here are the same, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:11.45,0:01:11.78,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:12.36,0:01:14.89,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,What Lain will be tomorrow should be the same as those.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:15.65,0:01:16.58,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,I guess so.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:16.97,0:01:28.56,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I mean if your ego works properly, you can recognize that you exist continuously and confirm that that existence is "myself." If your ego doesn’t work properly...
Dialogue: 0,0:01:28.72,0:01:29.98,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,If it doesn’t?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:30.64,0:01:33.30,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,We call such a situation "identity disorder" in the medical field.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:34.26,0:01:39.36,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,On the other hand, there is also an "isolation disorder" which means you think that you are not yourself.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:39.93,0:01:42.20,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,He, he, they sound like bad diseases, don’t they?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:44.01,0:01:48.84,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Yet anyone your age usually doesn’t complete his or her ego until later.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:49.89,0:01:53.64,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,You just can gradually recognize yourself with age.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:54.88,0:01:57.49,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,So is it wrong to think that I understand myself at my age?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:58.00,0:02:01.10,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,It just happens to be that such things happen all the time.
