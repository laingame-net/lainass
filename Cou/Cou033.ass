Dialogue: 0,0:00:02.31,0:00:05.51,Default,Touko,0,0,0,, I’m sorry. I just was trying to explain this issue to you.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:06.56,0:00:10.48,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I like you too Lain, though I’m not sure why.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:11.30,0:00:16.07,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I suppose I just enjoy talking to you. That’s it.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:17.02,0:00:21.06,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,It’s probably just because I like my job!
Dialogue: 0,0:00:22.03,0:00:24.56,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I just thought it had to do with you, but I guess not.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:25.74,0:00:28.96,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,It is enough for me to be able to understand my feelings.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:29.94,0:00:41.06,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I can never read your mind, so I can never know that you like me as much as I like you.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:42.59,0:00:45.42,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,Sounds lonely...
Dialogue: 0,0:00:46.10,0:00:50.35,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I’m sorry, but you know, this is one of the ways for me to know that.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:51.90,0:00:56.30,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I’m so happy with you saying that you like me.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:57.63,0:01:00.74,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Are you happy with me saying I like you?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:01.48,0:01:02.54,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,Yes, indeed.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:03.74,0:01:10.51,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Yes, that is enough. Lain, I like you.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:11.58,0:01:18.06,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,But still, as you can never comprehend all of me, it is impossible for me to know everything about you.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:19.04,0:01:24.14,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,If we could know everything about each other, I could be you and vice versa.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:24.91,0:01:30.11,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I mean you do not have to be Lain unless we are different people.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:31.38,0:01:35.76,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I really like Lain even though Lain is hard to understand sometimes.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:36.92,0:01:38.70,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,You like the mysterious Lain?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:39.34,0:01:44.67,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Well, I like Lain who I don’t know very well. Of course, that is not all I like.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:45.80,0:01:48.67,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,I want to know everything about you!!
Dialogue: 0,0:01:49.18,0:01:53.27,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,So do I! But it’s impossible.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:54.06,0:01:54.64,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,Impossible?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:54.98,0:01:58.92,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Yes. That is because even I don’t know who I am!
Dialogue: 0,0:01:59.92,0:02:05.88,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Well, I don’t know how to explain this to you. Lain is Lain and I am me.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:07.42,0:02:12.50,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Actually it might be still impossible even if we became the same person.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:13.59,0:02:14.52,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,The same person?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:14.95,0:02:18.26,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Yes, Lain and I are exactly the same!
Dialogue: 0,0:02:19.34,0:02:24.06,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,We see the same things, have the same ideas and take same actions.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:24.96,0:02:26.63,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Everything.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:28.23,0:02:30.79,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Even our looks are the same!
Dialogue: 0,0:02:31.16,0:02:36.14,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,In this situation, there is only an identity that you KEEP, isn't there?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:37.40,0:02:39.53,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Yet even if such an identification is gone.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:39.71,0:02:41.52,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,If you thought "Here is Lain," then I cannot exist there.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:44.02,0:02:45.27,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,The same thing can happen to you!
Dialogue: 0,0:02:46.59,0:02:49.84,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,That is why it’s impossible to understand each other at the same time.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:50.92,0:02:54.20,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,But what if you would answer every question I ask.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:55.00,0:02:56.08,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,Still, it would be impossible?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:56.74,0:02:59.60,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Right, but they are not all possible questions, are they?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:00.48,0:03:10.64,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I need time to answer those questions and those answers could be changed eventually, such as I used to think one thing, but now I have changed my mind — something like that.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:11.55,0:03:13.78,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,It's impossible after all, isn’t it?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:14.78,0:03:22.30,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Yes, I wish I could go inside your mind and answer everything you want to know...
