Dialogue: 0,0:00:02.31,0:00:07.44,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,I write in my diary everyday. Sometimes I don’t have much to write, though.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:07.44,0:00:08.37,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Don’t worry about it.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:08.37,0:00:10.15,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,If you force yourself, you’ll just want to give up.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:10.64,0:00:15.10,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I don't know how many diaries I've had that I couldn't stick to for long.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:16.64,0:00:18.54,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Have you seen any of them since then?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:19.03,0:00:20.32,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,I’ve been okay.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:20.32,0:00:27.11,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Really? That’s good. There’s something I want to confirm with you today.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:27.89,0:00:28.87,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,What?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:29.56,0:00:32.44,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,You have really good eyesight, don’t you, Lain?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:32.88,0:00:34.14,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,Really good?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:34.14,0:00:38.72,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,You’ve had eye exams at school, haven’t you? What’s your score?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:40.16,0:00:41.42,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,One-point-five.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:42.16,0:00:45.21,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Your eyesight is really even better than that, isn’t it?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:46.39,0:00:49.48,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,But I wanted to have the same score as all the other kids.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:49.48,0:00:51.99,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Well, there’s no point having the examination, then.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:52.70,0:00:55.55,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,At the last hospital you used to go to, they examined your eyes, too.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:56.14,0:00:58.45,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,But they did it differently than at your school.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:58.45,0:01:01.44,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,They had a machine that measures eyesight automatically.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:03.08,0:01:09.24,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,The machine only measures as far as three-point-zero, and your score was three-point-zero.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:10.38,0:01:13.77,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Kids with such good eyesight are extremely rare, so...
Dialogue: 0,0:01:13.77,0:01:19.77,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,The doctor in charge of your eye-exam spoke with a cancer specialist, who said he saw no problems.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:20.62,0:01:21.77,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,Oh.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:22.09,0:01:26.10,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Lain, what can you see outside the window?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:27.31,0:01:30.80,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,Trees and a gate to the research center in the distance.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:31.24,0:01:32.68,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,And beyond that?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:33.25,0:01:33.96,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,Buildings.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:33.96,0:01:35.24,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,And beyond that?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:35.55,0:01:36.55,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,Mountains.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:36.55,0:01:37.79,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,And beyond that?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:38.32,0:01:39.32,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,I can’t see anything further.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:39.46,0:01:40.36,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Nothing at all?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:40.87,0:01:43.94,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,A purplish color that looks like a curtain.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:44.61,0:01:45.73,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Thank you.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:46.55,0:01:49.88,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I’m sorry to pepper you with all these questions.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:51.33,0:01:56.96,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I think that you probably see the world in a different way than I do.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:58.72,0:02:01.78,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Lain, don’t look so glum.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:01.78,0:02:03.76,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,It’s nothing to worry about.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:03.76,0:02:07.67,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,It’s not such a bad thing... I’m sorry for saying that.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:07.67,0:02:10.01,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I guess it is bad thing for you.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:10.01,0:02:11.36,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,To see things so differently.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:11.86,0:02:13.36,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,I don’t know.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:13.83,0:02:18.53,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,But I had a feeling that I’m probably different from everybody else.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:19.27,0:02:22.74,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,I feel like I’m the only person who can hear and see some things.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:23.24,0:02:24.96,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,It makes me very uncomfortable.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:25.40,0:02:26.96,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,I think that I will be disliked.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:27.62,0:02:28.96,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,Is that the reason?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:30.08,0:02:35.15,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,It might be. I think that you’d have to be seen by a specialist.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:36.30,0:02:43.22,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,No. I want to see you. I don’t want to see any of the other doctors here. They all scare me.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:48.88,0:02:50.78,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Why don’t we just keep this as a secret?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:51.44,0:02:52.34,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,A secret?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:52.34,0:02:56.75,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Uh huh. It will be our secret until you aren’t worried about it anymore.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:57.24,0:02:58.21,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,Is that okay?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:58.21,0:03:04.72,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I’m your big sister, remember? I’m not going to take you anywhere that you will be scared.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:05.19,0:03:06.41,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,Touko-san.
