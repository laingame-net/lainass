Dialogue: 0,0:00:00.00,0:00:03.24,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,Am I sick because I came to the hospital?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:03.24,0:00:08.77,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Well, you can carry on with your life, but you’re troubled, aren’t you Lain?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:08.77,0:00:12.91,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,It’s the job of a counselor to help with that.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:12.91,0:00:18.00,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,Are you a counselor, Toko-san? You said before that you’re a doctor.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:18.00,0:00:20.35,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I’m a counselor and a doctor.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:20.35,0:00:21.97,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,How are the two different?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:21.97,0:00:25.82,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Well, both jobs have to do with helping people with psychological problems.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:25.82,0:00:28.64,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,They’re similar in the sense that they have the same goals.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:28.64,0:00:32.88,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,But the difference is that as a counselor I care for patients differently than I do as a doctor, and that each job has different qualifications.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:32.88,0:00:43.04,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Each job has its strengths and weaknesses, and I think it’s best when I can make their strengths compliment each other.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:43.55,0:00:47.13,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,That’s why I’m a doctor and a counselor.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:47.13,0:00:51.26,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,Are you a doctor or a counselor when you see me?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:51.26,0:00:55.77,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I’m a counselor. I think it’s better for me to be a counselor when I see you.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:56.44,0:01:03.88,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,I’m not mentally ill? You said that the things I see are hallucinations.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:03.88,0:01:14.91,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,It’s true that hallucinations and delusions are symptoms of mental illness, and this is just my hunch, but you don’t seem to be mentally ill to me.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:14.91,0:01:17.62,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,Do I pay too much attention to things?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:17.62,0:01:19.62,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Yes, I think that’s probably right.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:20.06,0:01:26.17,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I think your tendency to observe things and listen to thing very carefully might be stressing you out.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:26.17,0:01:29.06,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,What can I do about it, Toko-san?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:29.06,0:01:33.95,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Well... even if I told you not to mind things too much, you’re going to mind things.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:34.60,0:01:41.60,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,I don't mind anymore. I’m getting used to this. Still, I can't get used to that.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:42.11,0:01:43.24,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,"That"?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:43.88,0:01:46.20,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,I’m not the me that I am right now.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:46.97,0:01:48.80,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,What kind of Lain are you?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:49.26,0:01:52.06,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,I’m me. That person is, too.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:52.95,0:01:55.31,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Why do you feel that way?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:55.31,0:02:01.93,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,I don’t know. Have you ever thought that you aren’t you, Toko-san?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:02.53,0:02:10.15,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Looking back on myself in the past, I’ve wondered what I was doing sometimes.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:10.15,0:02:13.73,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,But I’ve never thought at the time that I wasn’t me.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:14.77,0:02:18.22,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Do you feel that there are two of you, Lain?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:18.22,0:02:23.40,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,No. I’m me and I’m not me.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:24.62,0:02:26.22,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,That’s mysterious.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:26.22,0:02:30.24,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,But if you feel that way, that must be true for you.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:30.24,0:02:32.35,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,You don’t have to feel that you’re mistaken.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:32.35,0:02:35.04,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,But it isn’t usual.
