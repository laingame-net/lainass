Dialogue: 0,0:00:02.95,0:00:04.51,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Hmm.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:04.51,0:00:10.00,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,There is a delusion some people have that they are being influenced by something.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:10.62,0:00:15.00,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,The delusion that the radio or TV or cell phones are trying to influence them somehow.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:15.00,0:00:24.17,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,The delusion that TV and cell phones have the power to touch them physically.

Dialogue: 0,0:00:29.88,0:00:30.73,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,Uh, huh.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:31.24,0:00:33.24,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,It might not even be a delusion.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:33.24,0:00:36.33,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,There is an actual medical condition that makes people very sensitive physically.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:36.33,0:00:41.55,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,But you said that you don’t feel like you are yourself, didn’t you, Lain?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:41.55,0:00:46.04,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,That makes me think that you have the delusion that nothing exists.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:46.04,0:00:49.53,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,That you think you aren’t real and that existence isn’t real.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:49.53,0:00:53.62,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,This can come as the result of poor self-esteem.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:53.62,0:00:55.80,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,Poor self-esteem?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:55.80,0:01:01.11,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,It’s the feeling that one is worthless.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:01.11,0:01:05.11,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,It’s similar to the delusion of persecution we were talking about.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:05.66,0:01:09.80,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,I’m really sick.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:09.80,0:01:11.04,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,There are other kinds of delusions.

Dialogue: 0,0:01:12.46,0:01:18.28,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Some people have the delusion that they have a special, unique sickness.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:18.28,0:01:23.02,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,It’s the sickness of thinking they have a sickness, when they really aren’t sick.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:23.93,0:01:30.22,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I think that what you have, Lain, is mostly to do with this kind of delusion.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:30.22,0:01:33.80,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,The sickness of thinking that I am sick when I’m not sick?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:33.80,0:01:34.91,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Yes.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:34.91,0:01:41.80,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I think that you have poor self-esteem, and that a small insecurity manifests itself in nightmares, and makes you think that you are sick.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:41.80,0:01:43.17,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,Can I be cured?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:43.17,0:01:44.51,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Sure!
Dialogue: 0,0:01:44.51,0:01:46.91,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,After all, you’re not sick in the first place.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:47.55,0:01:50.51,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I’m sorry to have alarmed you.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:50.51,0:01:57.20,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Still, if you don’t understand psychiatry well, you can use it to make all sorts of misguided conclusions.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:57.20,0:01:59.33,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,You can diagnose yourself as being sick.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:59.33,0:02:08.40,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Most people go to the doctor when they or someone they know can’t carry on their day-to-day activities.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:08.40,0:02:13.22,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,They come in to see a doctor and they are diagnosed or treated, and sometimes they are diagnosed as sick.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:13.22,0:02:20.48,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,So for someone like you, who can continue her own day-to-day activities without a problem, we can’t really say that you are sick unless something’s bad enough that you need hospitalization.
