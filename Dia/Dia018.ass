Dialogue: 0,0:00:00.50,0:00:03.48,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I spoke to my client about her vision.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:04.12,0:00:16.98,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,There is a good chance that she may develop a troubling complex by comparing herself to others, thinking that she is uniquely—and abnormally—able to see and hear better than them.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:18.12,0:00:26.06,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,At the same time, instead of just saying that she has hyperesthesia, I believe she is dealing with the kind of déjà vu that neurotic people sometimes experience.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:26.06,0:00:32.88,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I will exclude the details, but it seems that what she perceives comes from a poor sense of reality, and her true perceptions are abandoned.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:34.10,0:00:39.70,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Regarding her perception of time, if the client is telling the truth, there isn’t much of a problem.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:40.52,0:00:56.58,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I don’t know what she actually sees, or whether it’s due to a physical abnormality or an abnormality of perception, but as long as her underestimation of herself persists, it will be difficult to reach any fundamental solutions.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:57.88,0:01:07.20,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I cannot diagnose her with depersonalization neurosis just yet, but when I consider her fuzzy recollections of hallucinations, I do think she may be developing depersonalization symptoms.
